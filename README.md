## Description

This is a simple pizza ordering web page created to demonstrate understanding of Object-Oriented JavaScript. Using the page, a person may customize a pizza by choosing toppings and sizes, and the web page will display the total cost of the pizza.

## Specifications

* There are three size options: personal, medium, and large.
* Each size will be assigned a base price.
* If a size is not selected, the default selection and price will be "medium".

**User selects their toppings using checkboxes.**
